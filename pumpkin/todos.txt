finish randomisation of initial vsids values
finish assumption (interface)

make a testing framework so that it is easier later to evaluate changes and correctness

only allow the assignments_integer to create predicates

better clause data structure
binary watches
custom vectors
clause minimisation

better watch list data structure
lazy explanations
lifting can be problematic given the updates of literals wrt to the domains
add views for variables

move file reading outside Pumpkin?

add integration with MiniZinc (@Maarten?)
  this may imply preprocessing of CP models, need to see how to do this properly

clean up copying in the code, and replace with references where appropriate (not sure it would make a difference in the cases that are left)
  e.g., when passing a predicate or when returning predicates or trail entries

could investigate adding explanation clauses permanently, as learned clauses, or not all. For now we do not add them to the problem.

implement .iter() for propositional conjunction, currently it has an into_iter but it is not working as intended

currently if you create integer variables, do some solving, and then add a propagator over those variables, the bounds of the variables will not be correctly stored
  this is an exotic use case but could fix this later
